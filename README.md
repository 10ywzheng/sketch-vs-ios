## About

This app was used to investigate some rendering differences between Sketch and iOS. The original post which contains screenshots, gifs, and explanations can be found here:

[Medium Post — Why Your App Looks Better in Sketch](http://medium.com)

The app is best seen in-person on a real device which is why it is freely available to download, install, and modify.
